    - **Whiskers** extend to show the range of the data, excluding outliers, which are plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers.
    - By examining this plot, we can identify which genres have higher energy levels and the variability within each genre. 
    - For instance, genres like EDM may show higher energy levels with a wider range, while classical music may cluster around lower energy values.
    - This visualization helps us understand how energy levels differ not only between genres but also within them, revealing unique trends and listener preferences.
